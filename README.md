# Code Notes

This is a collection of code notes or things learned over time for various languages, TDD, etc. and stuff I like to revisit from time-to-time cause I forget things :).

## **React**
 >  Note: Contains a copy of the Docs from React's website as of 4/29/2018.  I don't plan on keeping this in sync with the React site.  It's just to port it over which is good enough, and then add onto it with useful information from other sources on the web

- [React Basics](react-basics.md)

>  Note: a lot of the "You Don't Know JS" content was ported over and I tried to strip out fluff..it's too wordyga .
       gcmsg 'grammer correction'in places and I wanted a shortened version of it for review.  So this is no an exact copy, I've modified it by arranging it better by adding bullets, etc. Contains a copy of the Docs from "You Don't Know JS" as of 4/29/2018
