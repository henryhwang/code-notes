# Code Notes

This is a collection of code notes learned over time for various languages, TDD, etc. and serves as a good concise reference from time-to-time

# How to Navigate Notes
It's hard to digest everthing in the extensive .md files on each particular topic.

So I'm taking an iterative approach to digesting all this information and thus creating little "iterative cheat sheets" that allow you to gradually dive into each topic

You should start with the mini-1 cheat sheets, move to mini-2, and then once you have those down well and memorized, you can dive into the extreme "guts" on each topic

I think this a much better way to retain this information.

### *mini-1 notes format*
These serve as more of quick "cheat sheet" and something you can start with.  Then dive more into the details via the mini-2.md files

- **Topic Header**
    - Definition
    - Small Details (enough to keep in your head)
    - Benefits
    - Disadvantages
    - Examples (as real-world as possible)

### mini-2 notes format:
these extend mini-1 notes and take a deeper dive.  They're still a cheat sheet with shorter bullet points compared to the major .md files on that area.

- **Topic Header** (matches the headers in mini-1)
    - More Details that extend the list in mini-1
    - In depth Examples (as real-world as possible)

## **React**
 >  Note: Contains a copy of the Docs from React's website as of 4/29/2018.  I don't plan on keeping this in sync with the React site.  It's just to port it over which is good enough, and then add onto it with useful information from other sources on the web

## **Redux**
## **JavaScript**
**Note:**
> A lot of the "You Don't Know JS" content (which is in the first 6 `js-basics.md` files) was ported over and I did 2 things
> - I tried to strip out fluff
> - I find his stuff hard to read because there are a lot of big paragraphs
>    - So what I did was I bullet the subsequent sentences in a paragraph which allows your eyes breathing room (much like I just did right here :))
    - You can read the first sentence in a paragraph, and then other sentences end up as talking points basically right under as bullets instead of one long paragraph.
> - Note that the You Don't Know JS stuff is not going to be kept up-to-date, for me it's good enough just getting the copy over here one time.  Yes they'll be outdated but that's more on the ES6 stuff which I can always add later
